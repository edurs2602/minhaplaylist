<br>    In my hour of need
<br>    Ha! No, you're not there
<br>    And though I reached out for you
<br>    Wouldn't lend a hand
<br>    
<br>    Through the darkest hour
<br>    Your grace did not shine on me
<br>    It feels so cold, very cold
<br>    No one cares for me
<br>    
<br>    Did you ever think I get lonely?
<br>    Did you ever think that I needed love?
<br>    Did you ever think to stop thinking?
<br>    You're the only one that I'm thinking of
<br>    
<br>    You'll never know how hard I tried
<br>    To find my space and satisfy you too.
<br>    
<br>    Things will be better when I'm dead and gone
<br>    Don't try to understand, knowing you I'm probably wrong.
<br>    
<br>    But, oh, how I lived my life for you!
<br>    Still you'd turn away
<br>    Now as I die for you,
<br>    My flesh still crawls, as I breathe your name
<br>    All these years I thought I was wrong
<br>    Now I know it was you!
<br>    Raise you head, raise your face your eyes
<br>    Tell me, who do you think you are?
<br>    
<br>    I walk, I walk alone
<br>    Into the promised land.
<br>    There's a better place for me
<br>    But it's far, far away
<br>    
<br>    Everlasting life for me
<br>    In a perfect world
<br>    But I gotta die first,
<br>    Please, God, send me on my way!
<br>    
<br>    Time has a way of taking time
<br>    Loneliness is not only felt by fools
<br>    Alone I call to ease the pain
<br>    Yearning to be held by you
<br>    Alone so alone, I'm lost
<br>    Consumed by the pain
<br>    The pain, the pain, the pain
<br>    
<br>    Won't you hold me again?
<br>    And you just laughed, ha! Ha! Bitch!
<br>    My whole life is work built on the past
<br>    But the time has come when all things shall pass
<br>    This good thing passed away
