<br> Brother will kill brother
<br> Spilling blood across the land
<br> Killing for religion
<br> Something I don't understand
<br>
<br> Fools like me, who cross the sea
<br> And come to foreign lands
<br> Ask the sheep, for their beliefs
<br> Do you kill on God's command?
<br>
<br> A country that's divided
<br>Surely will not stand
<br>My past erased, no more disgrace
<br>No foolish naive stand
<br>
<br>The end is near, it's crystal clear
<br>Part of the master plan
<br>Don't look now to Israel
<br>It might be your homelands
<br>
<br>Holy wars
<br>
<br>Upon my podium, as the know it all scholar
<br>Down in my seat of judgement
<br>Gavel's bang, uphold the law
<br>Up on my soapbox, a leader
<br>Out to change the world
<br>Down in my pulpit as the holier
<br>Than-thou-could-be-messenger of God
<br>
<br>Wage the war on organized crime
<br>Sneak attacks, repel down the rocks
<br>Behind the lines
<br>Some people risk to employ me
<br>Some people live to destroy me
<br>Either way they die, they die
<br>
<br>They killed my wife and my baby
<br>With hopes to enslave me
<br>First mistake, last mistake!
<br>Paid by the alliance, to slay all the giants
<br>Next mistake, no more mistakes!
<br>
<br>Fill the cracks in, with judicial granite
<br>Because I don't say it
<br>Don't mean I ain't thinkin' it
<br>Next thing you know
<br>They'll take my thoughts away
<br>
<br>I know what I said
<br>Now I must scream of the overdose
<br>And the lack of mercy killings
<br>Mercy killings
<br>Mercy killings, killings, killings, killings
<br>
<br>Next thing you know
<br>They'll take my thoughts away
