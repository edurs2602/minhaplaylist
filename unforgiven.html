<br> New blood joins this earth
<br> And, quickly, he's subdued
<br> Through constant pained disgrace
<br> The young boy learns their rules
<br>
<br> With time, the child draws in
<br> This whipping boy done wrong
<br> Deprived of all his thoughts
<br> The young man struggles on and on, he's known
<br> A vow unto his own
<br> That never from this day
<br> His will they'll take away
<br>
<br> What I've felt
<br> What I've known
<br> Never shined through in what I've shown
<br> Never be
<br> Never see
<br> Won't see what might have been
<br>
<br> What I've felt
<br> What I've known
<br> Never shined through in what I've shown
<br> Never free
<br> Never me
<br> So I dub thee Unforgiven
<br>
<br> They dedicate their lives
<br> To running all of his
<br> He tries to please them all
<br> This bitter man he is
<br>
<br> Throughout his life the same
<br> He's battled constantly
<br> This fight he cannot win
<br> A tired man, they see no longer cares
<br> The old man then prepares
<br> To die regretfully
<br> That old man here is me
<br>
<br> What I've felt
<br> What I've known
<br> Never shined through in what I've shown
<br> Never be
<br> Never see
<br> Won't see what might have been
<br>
<br> What I've felt
<br> What I've known
<br> Never shined through in what I've shown
<br> Never free
<br> Never me
<br> So I dub thee Unforgiven
