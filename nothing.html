<br> So close no matter how far
<br> Couldn't be much more from the heart
<br> Forever trusting who we are
<br> And nothing else matters
<br>
<br> Never opened myself this way
<br> Life is ours, we live it our way
<br> All these words I don't just say
<br> And nothing else matters
<br>
<br> Trust I seek and I find in you
<br> Every day for us something new
<br> Open mind for a different view
<br> And nothing else matters
<br>
<br> Never cared for what they do
<br> Never cared for what they know
<br> But I know
<br>
<br> So close no matter how far
<br> It couldn't be much more from the heart
<br> Forever trusting who we are
<br> And nothing else matters
<br>
<br> Never cared for what they do
<br> Never cared for what they know
<br> But I know
<br>
<br> I never opened myself this way
<br> Life is ours, we live it our way
<br> All these words I don't just say
<br> And nothing else matters
<br>
<br> Trust I seek and I find in you
<br> Every day for us something new
<br> Open mind for a different view
<br> And nothing else matters
<br>
<br> Never cared for what they say
<br> Never cared for games they play
<br> Never cared for what they do
<br> Never cared for what they know
<br> And I know
<br>
<br> So close no matter how far
<br> Couldn't be much more from the heart
<br> Forever trusting who we are
<br> No, nothing else matters
