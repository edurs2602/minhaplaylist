<br> We shall go on to the end
<br> We shall fight in France
<br> We shall fightover the seas and oceans.
<br> we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
<br> We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be
<br> we shall fight on beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds
<br> we shall fight in the fields and in the streets
<br> we shall fight on the hills.
<br> We shall never surrender."
<br>
<br> There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
<br> Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
<br> Out for the scramble, we've got to get airborne
<br> Got to get up for the coming attack
<br>
<br> Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
<br> Remove all the wheelblocks, there's no time to waste
<br> Gathering speed as we head down the runway
<br> Got to get airborne before it's too late
<br>
<br> Running, scrambling, flying
<br> Rolling, turning, diving
<br> Going in again
<br> Running, scrambling, flying
<br> Rolling, turning, diving
<br>
<br> Run
<br> Live to fly, fly to live, do or die
<br> Won't you
<br> Run, live to fly, fly to live
<br> Aces high
<br>
<br> Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
<br> Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
<br> Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
<br> Move to their blindsides and firing again
<br>
<br> Bandits at 8 o'clock are moving behind us
<br> Ten ME-109's out of the sun
<br> Ascending and turning, our spitfires to face them
<br> Heading straight for them I press down my guns
<br>
<br> Rolling, turning, diving
<br> Rolling, turning, diving
<br> Going in again
<br> Rolling, turning, diving
<br> Rolling, turning, diving
<br>
<br> Run
<br> Live to fly, fly to live, do or die
<br> Won't you
<br> Run, live to fly, fly to live
<br> Aces high
