    <br>    Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
    <br>    About a thing that I saw
    <br>    One night wandering in the everglades
    <br>    I'd one drink but no more
    <br>    
    <br>    I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
    <br>    Gazing up at the stars
    <br>    Not aware of a presence so near to me
    <br>    Watching my every move
    <br>    
    <br>    Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
    <br>    As something rushed me from the trees
    <br>    Took me to an unholy place
    <br>    And that is where I fell from grace
    <br>    
    <br>    Then they summoned me over to join in with them
    <br>    To the dance of the dead
    <br>    In to the circle of fire I followed them
    <br>    Into the middle I was led
    <br>    
    <br>    As if time had stopped still
    <br>    I was numb with fear, but still, I wanted to go
    <br>    And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
    <br>    As I walked on to the coals
    <br>    
    <br>    Then I felt I was in a trance
    <br>    And my spirit was lifted from me
    <br>    And if only someone had the chance
    <br>    To witness what happened to me
    <br>    
    <br>    And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
    <br>    All had death in their eyes
    <br>    Lifeless figures they were undead all of them
    <br>    They had ascended from hell
    <br>    
    <br>    As I danced with the dead
    <br>    My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
    <br>    Below my undead body just danced the circle of death
    <br>   
    <br>    Until the time came to reunite us both
    <br>    My spirit came back down to me
    <br>    I didn't know if I was alive or dead
    <br>    As the others all joined in with me
