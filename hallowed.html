<br> I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime
<br> Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
<br> 'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
<br> The sands of time for me are running low
<br> Running low, yeah!
<br>
<br> When the priest comes to read me the last rites
<br> I take a look through the bars at the last sights
<br> Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
<br>
<br> Can it be that there's some sort of error
<br> Hard to stop the surmounting terror
<br> Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?
<br>
<br> Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
<br> It's not easy to stop from screaming
<br> But words escape me when I try to speak
<br>
<br> Tears flow but why am I crying?
<br> After all I'm not afraid of dying
<br> Don't I believe that there never is an end?
<br>
<br> As the guards march me out to the courtyard
<br> Somebody cries from a cell: God be with you
<br> If there's a God, why has He let me go?
<br>
<br> As I walk, my life drifts before me
<br> Though the end is near I'm not sorry
<br> Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away
<br>
<br> Mark my words believe my soul lives on
<br> Don't worry now that I have gone
<br> I've gone beyond to see the truth
<br>
<br> When you know that your time is close at hand
<br> Maybe then you'll begin to understand
<br> Life down here is just a strange illusion
<br>
<br> Hallowed be thy name
